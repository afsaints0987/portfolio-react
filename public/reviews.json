    "review_text": "I had the privilege of working with Aaron on one of our cloud development projects. In a relatively short time, he demonstrated remarkable ability and eagerness not only to learn but also to contribute to a number of methods of engaging and integrating cloud-based systems to improve our end-user experience. His technical ability and problem-solving skills as a full-stack web developer enabled their team to navigate complex concepts that ensured that tasks were not only completed but were delivered with great attention to detail.\n\nBeyond his technical ability, Aaron actively collaborated on a handful of development projects that were part of the companyâ€™s initiative to improve its current employee experience. His dedication and work ethic were invaluable during our sprints and contributed greatly to rapidly deploying changes on the project. It was a pleasure working with him and Iâ€™m confident that he would bring the same experience to any of his future endeavors.",
